Got so fed up with mobile devices creating image files named `DCIM_01.JPG`
or similar, hence having the same filenames after importing them to my
computer.

One annoying example is Sony Xperia which saves burst images in separate folders
but the filenames inside those folders are always the same.

This tool will solve that step in the process when renaming and organising images.

The given directory will be searched recursively for media files and they all will be renamed to the given directory.
Those directories which are touched during the operation, in case they will be empty after the rename, the directory will be renamed.

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `8.11.1`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

## Installation

Make sure to have both [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) and
[Mediainfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) available in the `PATH` environment variable.

The versions supported are [GraphicsMagick `1.3.x`](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/NEWS.html)
and [MediaInfo `0.7.x`](https://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo/ChangeLog).

They can be installed for example for macOS via [Brew](http://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install graphicsmagick mediainfo
```

In Ubuntu Linux it can be done with command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick mediainfo
```

In Windows, the applications need to be downloaded from their sites and once installed,
their installation paths should be added in the `Path` system environment variable.

Now install the command line tool globally, which might need increased privileges:

```sh
[sudo] npm install --global image-flatify
```

## Command line options

```sh
image-flatify --help
```

```sh
image-flatify [options] <directory> [more directories]

  -h, --help                 Help and usage instructions
  -V, --version              Version number
  -v, --verbose              Verbose output, will print which file is currently being processed
  -n, --dry-run              Try it out without actually touching anything
  -K, --keep-in-directories  Keep the renamed image files in their original directory
  -p, --prefix String        Prefix for the resulting filename, default empty
  -a, --append-hash          Always append a hash string to the filename instead of a possible counter
  -l, --lowercase-suffix     Lowercase the resulting file suffixes, or use as is by default
  -D, --no-delete-empty-directories  Do not delete any directories that become empty after processing

Version 0.9.0
```

### Example commands

The following command shows how the renaming would be done in the current directory, but it is
not done since the `--dry-run` option is used.

```sh
image-flatify -vn .
```

## Contributing

First thing to do is to file [an issue](https://github.com/paazmaya/image-flatify/issues).

["A Beginner's Guide to Open Source: The Best Advice for Making your First Contribution"](http://www.erikaheidi.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-the-best-advice-for-making-your-first-contribution/).

[Also there is a blog post about "45 Github Issues Dos and Donâ€™ts"](https://davidwalsh.name/45-github-issues-dos-donts).

Linting is done with [ESLint](http://eslint.org) and can be executed with `npm run lint`.
There should be no errors appearing after any JavaScript file changes.

Unit tests are written with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) and can be executed with `npm test`.

Code coverage is inspected with [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and
can be executed with `npm run coverage` after running `npm test`.
Please make sure it is over 90% at all times.
